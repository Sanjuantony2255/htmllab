<P>Holi (Hindi pronunciation: ['hoÀêli:]) is a popular and significant Hindu festival celebrated as the Festival of Colours, Love and Spring.It celebrates the eternal and divine love of the gods Radha and Krishna. Additionally, the day also signifies the triumph of good over evil,[14][15] as it commemorates the victory of Vishnu as Narasimha Narayana over Hiranyakashipu. Holi originated and is predominantly celebrated in the Indian subcontinent but has also spread to other regions of Asia and parts of the Western world through the Indian diaspora.[10][18][19][20][21][22][23][24]

Holi also celebrates the arrival of Spring in India, the end of winter, and the blossoming of love.[18][25] It is also an invocation for a good spring harvest season.[18][25] It lasts for a night and a day, starting on the evening of the Purnima (Full Moon Day) falling in the Hindu calendar month of Phalguna, which falls around the middle of March in the Gregorian calendar.
